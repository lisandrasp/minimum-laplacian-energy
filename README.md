# Minimum Laplacian Energy

Simple Python scripts using [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) to find the minimum Laplacian energy of 
[unicyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoforest#Definitions_and_structure).  
These scripts were written for an undergraduate research project in spectral graph theory at the [Federal University of 
Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home).  

**Please notice** that _parallel_01_ and _parallel_02_ don't work at all and are here for archiving purposes only. I've 
opened a thread [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57824/is-it-possible-for-the-spectrum-method-to-use-all-cpu-cores/)
regarding the issue.
